## Overview

This project is a simple social links profile page built using HTML and CSS. The page displays a profile picture, name, address, and a brief description of the person. It also includes links to various social media platforms.

### The challenge

-One challenge was to create a responsive design that works well on different devices and screen sizes. The solution was to use flexbox layout and media queries to adjust the layout and styles based on the screen size.

-Another challenge was to create a smooth hover effect on the social media links. The solution was to use CSS transitions to create a smooth transition between the normal and hover states.
